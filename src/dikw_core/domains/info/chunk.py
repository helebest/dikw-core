"""Heading-aware markdown chunker.

Strategy (inspired by ``qmd/src/store.ts:257-310`` and
``mineru-doc-explorer/src/store.ts``):

* Split the body into paragraphs separated by blank lines.
* Greedily pack paragraphs into chunks of up to ``max_tokens`` tokens.
* Force a chunk boundary immediately before any heading if the current chunk
  already has substantive content — this keeps headings at chunk starts,
  which matches retrieval intuition.
* Carry the tail of the previous chunk into the next as a paragraph-level
  overlap (~``overlap_ratio`` of ``max_tokens``). Overlap is by paragraph,
  not by word, so character offsets stay exact and no paragraph is split
  mid-sentence.

Token counting goes through ``info/tokenize.count_tokens`` so CJK
paragraphs (which contain no whitespace) get jieba-segmented before the
budget comparison. ASCII bodies fall through to ``len(text.split())``.
``cjk_tokenizer`` plumbs through ``RetrievalConfig.cjk_tokenizer`` so
existing wikis configured with ``"none"`` keep their original chunk
boundaries (and cached embeddings) instead of silently re-chunking.
