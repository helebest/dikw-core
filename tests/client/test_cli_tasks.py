"""``dikw client tasks *`` subgroup tests.

After the task-first CLI flip, the subgroup is:

* ``tasks list`` (unchanged) — list rows
* ``tasks status <id>`` (renamed from ``show``) — single-row JSON
* ``tasks events <id> --from-seq N --limit M --wait K`` (new) — single
  paged GET to the cursor endpoint, raw JSON to stdout
* ``tasks wait <id> --poll-wait K --timeout S`` (new) — long-poll loop
  until terminal, exit code mapped (0 / 1 / 130 / 124)
* ``tasks cancel <id>`` (unchanged)
* ~~``tasks follow``~~ — removed; ``tasks wait`` covers it

This file owns the contract for the new commands + the removed-shape
regression coverage; ``tasks list`` / ``tasks cancel`` already have
coverage elsewhere.
