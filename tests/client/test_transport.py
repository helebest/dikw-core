"""Transport behaviour against the in-memory ASGI server.

These tests intentionally drive the real server (via the ``asgi_client``
fixture chain) instead of mocking httpx — we want the wire contract
between :class:`Transport` and ``dikw_core.server`` exercised together
so that schema drift on either side fails loudly.
