# ---- fuzzy normalize (PR1) -----------------------------------------------
#
# `resolve_links` does exact + case-insensitive lookup today; that misses
# typing variations users hit constantly: "Neural Network" vs
# "Neural Networks", "Elon Musk" vs "Elon Musk.", full-width 中文 punctuation
# trailing the title, etc. PR1 adds a deterministic L1 (NFKC + casefold +
# punctuation strip) + L2 (trailing s/es/ies stem) normalize that fires
# *after* exact + case-insensitive miss. Collision-on-normalize must NOT
# resolve — falling back to broken_wikilink keeps `dikw lint` honest.
