"""Hermetic K-layer eval gate.

Smoke-tests ``run_synth_eval`` end-to-end with ``FakeLLM`` +
``FakeEmbeddings`` — no API keys, no network. The dataset is built
in-process so the test stays independent of changes to packaged
datasets under ``evals/datasets/``.

Per spec: hermetic mode does NOT enforce realistic thresholds. The
test only verifies the runner wires up correctly, every K-layer
metric is present and in ``[0, 1]`` range, and the report's
structural invariants hold (``n_pages > 0``, ``threshold_results``
matches declared thresholds, etc.). Realistic thresholds get
calibrated separately by ``dikw client eval mvp --eval synth`` against the
real LLM in Step 8 dogfood.
