"""Multimedia asset materialization + path composition.

v1 scope: images only. Audio/video extension points are reserved on the
schemas (`AssetKind`, `MultimodalInput`) but not exercised here.

This module owns the contract between Markdown source references like
``![alt](./diagrams/foo.png)`` and the engine-managed on-disk layout at
``<project_root>/assets/<h2>/<h8>-<sanitized-name>.<ext>``. The path scheme
combines a 256-way sha256 prefix shard (FS-friendly under heavy ingest)
with the original file name preserved for human/Obsidian readability.
