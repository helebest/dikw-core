"""NDJSON streaming helper for task event endpoints.

The server emits one JSON object per line (``application/x-ndjson``) so
clients can incrementally parse without HTTP/2 server-sent-events
ceremony. This module provides:

  * ``ndjson_lines`` — joins a historical replay (from ``TaskStore``)
    with a live tail (from ``ProgressBus``) and injects a heartbeat
    every ``HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`` seconds so reverse proxies don't close
    the long-poll.
  * ``stream_response`` — wraps the iterator in a ``StreamingResponse``
    with the right Content-Type and a no-buffering hint header.

Heartbeats are NOT persisted in the store; they carry ``seq=0`` and
clients drop them on parse.

      2. If the bus is already closed for this task (terminal state
         persisted), stop — the replay above contains the full tape.
      3. Otherwise subscribe to the bus AND poll the store on a short
         interval. The bus is the fast path for in-process tasks; the
         store-poll is the cross-worker safety net — in a multi-worker
         or multi-replica deployment the follower may land on a worker
         that never saw the task in memory, so its bus has nothing to
         hand back. Polling lets that follower still tail the task to
         terminal even though every event arrives via the persistent
         tape, not the in-process bus.
      4. Inject a heartbeat every ``heartbeat_interval`` seconds while
         the stream is otherwise quiet.
