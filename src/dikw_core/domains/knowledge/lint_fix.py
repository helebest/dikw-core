"""Wiki-lint fix-proposal subsystem.

`run_lint` (in :mod:`lint`) reports four classes of K-layer hygiene
issues but never proposes how to fix them. This module adds a
``propose`` / ``apply`` pair so each lint issue can become a structured,
reviewable, applicable repair plan.

The contract is:

* :class:`Fixer` — Protocol implemented per ``LintKind``. Given a
  :class:`LintIssue` and a :class:`FixerContext`, returns a
  :class:`FixProposal` (or ``None`` if the issue isn't fixable).
* :func:`run_lint_propose` — orchestrator. Single task, serial loop:
  one ``ProgressEvent`` per issue, one ``LogEvent`` per skipped issue.
  Fixer-level failures don't fail the whole task — they accumulate in
  :attr:`FixProposalReport.skipped` and the loop moves on.
* :func:`run_lint_apply` — executor. Reads a :class:`FixProposalReport`
  produced earlier, optionally filters by ``pick`` / ``skip``, validates
  each :attr:`FixOperation.expected_hash` against the on-disk file
  bytes (concurrent-edit guard), then mutates ``wiki/`` via
  :func:`wiki.write_page` / unlink. Outgoing-link reconciliation rides
  the existing ``storage.replace_links_from`` machinery (PR #66).
