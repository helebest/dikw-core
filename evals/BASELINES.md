# Baselines

Archive of real-embedder benchmark runs. Each entry pins a reproducible
configuration and the observed numbers, so future runs can tell a
regression from a re-run variance.

Newest first. `dikw eval` thresholds in each dataset's `dataset.yaml`
are calibrated ~2-3 % below the most recent canonical-mode run.

## 2026-04-28 — Phase 1.5 chunk-level fusion @ Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B

**Status:** new canonical baseline for both `cmteb-t2-subset` and
`scifact` under PR #27 PR-A's chunk-level fusion path
(`embed_versions` registry + per-version `vec_chunks_v<id>` tables).
Embedding model flipped from `Qwen3-Embedding-8B` (matryoshka 1024)
to `Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` (native 1024) — same vector-space dim,
~13× fewer params. SciFact thresholds rebased to 0.6B levels;
CMTEB thresholds unchanged (0.6B comfortably above the existing
floor).

### What changed from the 2026-04-24 baselines

1. **Embedding model: `Qwen3-Embedding-8B` → `Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`.**
   Both produce 1024-dim vectors on Gitee AI's
   `https://ai.gitee.com/v1` endpoint (8B via matryoshka truncation,
   0.6B native). Configured in
   `tests/fixtures/live-minimax-gitee.dikw.yml` and the two scratch
   wikis at `/tmp/dikw-phase15-{cmteb,scifact}/dikw.yml`. Verified
   via `dikw check --embed-only` (cold response 2.4 s, dim=1024 as
   expected). Motivation: 0.6B is dramatically cheaper / faster on
   Gitee in throttle-prone windows; we wanted to know if it's
   equivalent on quality.
2. **Schema is now PR #27 PR-A's chunk-level layout.**
   `chunk_embed_meta` per chunk, `embed_cache` re-keyed by
   `(content_hash, version_id)`, per-version `vec_chunks_v<id>` table
   created lazily on first ingest. The 8B-built CMTEB snapshot at
   `evals/.cache/snapshots/cmteb-t2-subset/Qwen3-Embedding-8B__1024__32540e83__mig3/`
   was wiped (legacy `content` table from PR #22, plus stale
   `chunks_vec` singleton from pre-PR-A) and rebuilt under 0.6B from
   scratch. SciFact wiki was scaffolded but never ingested previously
   — built fresh from `evals/datasets/scifact/corpus/` (5,183 files
   copied into the wiki's `sources/`).
3. **Replay tool (`evals/tools/run_phase15_from_snapshot.py`) tracked
   for the first time, with two Codex-flagged fixes folded in:**
   `[P1]` queries pinned to the snapshot's active `embed_versions`
   row via `storage.get_active_embed_version(modality="text")` so
   query vectors always live in the same space as the indexed chunks
   (mirrors `api.query()`); `[P2]` embedder construction gated on
   `mode in ("vector", "hybrid")` so `--mode bm25` no longer requires
   `DIKW_EMBEDDING_API_KEY`. The `[P2]` gate was empirically verified
   by a smoke run with all API keys unset — script reached
   `storage.migrate()` with zero embedding-related errors.

### Results

BM25 leg is **byte-for-byte identical** across the schema migration —
PR #27 PR-A's `ranked_docs_deduped` step in chunk-level fusion
preserves doc-level BM25 metrics, and PR #22's `content` table drop
didn't perturb the FTS5 path. Vector leg ties 8B within noise; hybrid
loses 0.006 nDCG@10 against 8B but stays comfortably above both
single-leg modes. Effectively a wash on CMTEB.

vs 8B v2 (2026-04-23):

| mode | metric | 8B v2 | 0.6B | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bm25 | nDCG@10 | 0.669 | 0.669 | **0.000** (byte-identical) |

| hybrid | hit@3 | 0.797 | 0.737 | -0.060 |
| hybrid | mrr | 0.734 | 0.662 | -0.072 |

**0.6B regresses ~0.05–0.10 across position-weighted metrics on
SciFact**, while CMTEB is essentially flat. The vector leg drops to
parity with BM25 (0.672 vs 0.669) — i.e., the dense leg has
**effectively zero semantic uplift over keyword retrieval** on
SciFact at 0.6B. recall@100 is the only metric that holds: 0.947 at
0.6B vs 0.947 at 8B (within noise) — the long tail still surfaces,
just at lower ranks.

### Why the asymmetric outcome

CMTEB-T2 is a **generic-domain Chinese passage retrieval task**;
0.6B's smaller capacity is offset by Qwen3's strong Chinese
pretraining, plus the question-form queries align well with the
passage corpus's surface vocabulary (high BM25 ceiling already does
most of the work — see hybrid bm25=0.840 vs vector=0.943 vs hybrid
0.946; vector+BM25 are close together, fusion gain is small).

SciFact is **biomedical scientific claim verification** — long-tail
specialist vocabulary (rare clinical terms, gene names, drug
references). At 8B, dense retrieval delivers a real ~0.10 nDCG@10
uplift over BM25 (0.773 vs 0.669). At 0.6B that uplift collapses
entirely (0.672 vs 0.669): the smaller model lacks the parametric
biomedical knowledge to pull rare-term queries above keyword level.
This is the textbook "small embedding model on specialist English"
failure mode and **is not a bug, it is the model's limit**.

### Threshold rebase

`evals/datasets/scifact/dataset.yaml` thresholds rebased ~3 % below
0.6B observed numbers (the established `dataset.yaml` convention).
This **lowers the gate floor** on SciFact — an honest 8B regression
that produces ~0.69 nDCG@10 will now pass the gate where it would
have failed before. Trade-off acknowledged: the gate now detects
"0.6B-class" regressions (model swap, ingest pipeline breakage,
fusion weight drift), not "8B-quality" ones. Re-raise if and when a
larger-model pipeline becomes the canonical eval target. CMTEB
thresholds unchanged (0.6B sits comfortably above the existing
floor).

### Configuration

| | |
|---|---|
| dikw commit | `5c6337f` (post-PR #29 main) |

| Embedding model | `Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`, **1024-dim native** |
| Embedding batch size | 16 (Gitee caps at 25) |
| Chunking | default heading-aware, 900 tokens, 15 % overlap |
| Fusion | RRF `(rrf_k=60, w_bm25=0.3, w_vec=1.5)` — shipped defaults |
| Storage schema | PR #27 PR-A: `chunk_embed_meta` + per-version `vec_chunks_v<id>` |
| Wiki layout | `/tmp/dikw-phase15-{cmteb,scifact}/` (out-of-tree scratch) |
| Replay tool | `evals/tools/run_phase15_from_snapshot.py` (this is its first tracked run) |
| Wall time, CMTEB ingest | ~10 min (5,000 chunks, ~6 s/batch under mild Gitee load) |
| Wall time, CMTEB eval | ~5 min (300 queries pre-batched + 3-mode search) |
| Wall time, SciFact ingest | ~10 min (5,183 chunks, similar batch latency) |
| Wall time, SciFact eval | ~5 min |
| Approximate cost | ~¥0.1 each on Gitee AI (10K total chunks × 1024-dim, 0.6B is cheaper than 8B per token) |

### Known issues / observations

**1. 0.6B is task-dependent.** CMTEB ≈ 8B; SciFact -0.10 nDCG@10
vector / -0.08 hybrid. Don't generalise the "0.6B is cheap and
adequate" finding past the regimes measured here. For
specialist-vocabulary English corpora (legal, medical, scientific),
plan to spend 8B-class budget or evaluate explicitly.

**2. Hybrid loses to vector on CMTEB at 0.6B.** Tiny (-0.003 nDCG@10
hybrid vs vector at 0.6B; on 8B v2 it was hybrid +0.010 over vector).
Within noise, but worth flagging: when vector is strong and BM25 is
already at 0.84, fusion has very little room to add. RRF's rank-based
nature limits the upside. Score-normalised fusion (CombSUM/CombMNZ)
remains an open follow-up from prior baselines and could matter more
on this kind of vector-dominated regime.

**3. Replay tool's `[P1]` correctness is contract-tested by behaviour,
not by code path.** The tool now passes `text_version_id` to
`HybridSearcher.from_config` and uses the active version's
`model`/`dim`. Tested via the actual CMTEB+SciFact runs (would have
caught a dim mismatch immediately). No unit test yet — the tool is
still a recovery utility, not a runner refactor (per its own module
docstring).

### Follow-ups (priority-ordered)

1. **Decide canonical model going forward.** Three reasonable
   stances: (a) keep 0.6B everywhere, accept SciFact gate semantics
   relaxation; (b) per-dataset model selection (8B for SciFact, 0.6B
   for CMTEB) — needs `dikw.yml` per-wiki, already supported; (c)
   pick a middle 1.5–4B model if Gitee offers one and re-baseline.
   Currently shipped: (a).
2. **Score-normalised fusion (CombSUM / CombMNZ).** Inherited from
   prior baselines. Now empirically motivated on CMTEB-0.6B too, not
   just SciFact: when both legs are close, RRF is a coarse averager.
3. **Pin replay tool with a smoke unit test.** Single-query CMTEB
   run with a fake version mismatch should exercise `[P1]` 's
   active-version pinning path. Cheap to add.
4. **Fix the `--dump-raw` query-id key issue (open from prior
   baselines).** Still open; not exercised by this run.
5. **Optional — full-corpus runs.** The 5K subsets undercount
   distractor density vs full-corpus. Spend ~¥1 / ~1 h to confirm
   the per-task asymmetry holds at full scale.

## 2026-04-24 — CMTEB / T2Retrieval v2 — CJK BM25 via jieba

**Status:** supersedes v1 as the canonical CMTEB baseline. Same
embeddings, same sampling, same fusion weights; what changed is
`retrieval.cjk_tokenizer: jieba` — the P0 from v1's "Follow-ups".

### What changed from v1

v1 exposed a broken BM25 leg on Chinese: SQLite FTS5's default
`unicode61` tokenizer segments CJK one character at a time, which
collapses BM25 to single-char IDF. 275 / 300 queries (91.7 %)
returned zero hits; nDCG@10 sat at 0.031 vs the published
Anserini+jieba baselines of 0.50–0.65. Hybrid degenerated to
vector-only because RRF had no signal from the BM25 leg to fuse with.

The fix landed across four commits on `feat/fts5-cjk-tokenizer`:

1. `info/tokenize.py` — `preprocess_for_fts(text, tokenizer=...)`
   runs `jieba.cut_for_search` over CJK runs only (regex-sliced so
   ASCII identifiers like `retrieval.rrf_k` pass through intact).
2. `RetrievalConfig.cjk_tokenizer: "none" | "jieba"` (default
   `"none"` at v2 baseline time — flipped to `"jieba"` in PR #24
   on 2026-04-26 so T7's chunker fix ships without config).
3. `SQLiteStorage` preprocesses title + body before the FTS insert;
   `_sanitize_fts` preprocesses the query identically. Locked at
   first ingest (same shape as `embedding_dimensions`).
4. CLI fix (`699abb6`, surfaced by the first v2 run producing
   identical numbers to v1): `dikw eval --embedder provider` now
   forwards `cfg.retrieval` from the scratch wiki to `run_eval`. The
   original CLI only threaded `cfg.provider` and silently dropped
   the retrieval block — the first v2 rerun wasted ~4h + ~¥0.5
   before this was caught. Regression test
   `test_cli_eval_provider_mode_threads_retrieval_config` pins it.

BM25: **0.031 → 0.840 nDCG@10 (27×)** — the broken leg is healed.
Hybrid now genuinely beats vector (+0.010 nDCG@10, +0.013 hit@3,
+0.026 MRR) instead of just matching it — the fusion is finally
doing useful work on Chinese.

### Weight sweep (offline, same dump)

Same 48-combination grid as v1. Top 5 + reference rows:

```
|   k | w_bm25 | w_vec | hit@3 | hit@10 |    mrr | nDCG@10 | recall@100 |
|----:|-------:|------:|------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|-----------:|
|  40 |   0.30 |  2.00 | 0.980 |  0.983 |  0.978 |   0.954 |      0.990 |
|  40 |   0.30 |  1.50 | 0.980 |  0.987 |  0.978 |   0.953 |      0.990 |
|  60 |   0.30 |  2.00 | 0.980 |  0.987 |  0.978 |   0.953 |      0.990 |
|  40 |   0.30 |  1.00 | 0.983 |  0.990 |  0.979 |   0.953 |      0.990 |
|  40 |   0.50 |  2.00 | 0.980 |  0.987 |  0.978 |   0.953 |      0.990 |
|  60 |   0.30 |  1.50 | 0.980 |  0.987 |  0.978 |   0.952 |      0.990 |  ← shipped default
|  60 |   1.00 |  1.00 | 0.983 |  0.990 |  0.974 |   0.930 |      0.990 |  ← equal-weight (pre-tuning)
```

The shipped default `(k=60, bm25_weight=0.3, vector_weight=1.5)` —
tuned on SciFact v2 back on 2026-04-23 — lands 0.002 below the grid
maximum on CMTEB and 0.022 above the equal-weight baseline. **The
v1 "generalisation" question is answered: the SciFact-tuned RRF
defaults generalise cleanly to Chinese.**

### Comparison vs published baselines

For BM25 on CJK, the published Anserini+jieba baselines on T2Retrieval
sit around nDCG@10 ≈ 0.50–0.65 (model- and configuration-dependent).
Our **0.840** on a 300-query / 5K-passage subset is naturally above
that range because the smaller corpus reduces distractor density
(only 1 in ~3× more chances for a random dense distractor to displace
a real hit). Treat as a calibration floor for re-runs, not a
leaderboard comparison.

For hybrid, our 0.952 is above the dense-only MTEB-CN leaderboard
cluster (0.85–0.93) for the same reason. The **directional signal**
— hybrid > vector > bm25, bm25 reaches usable signal on CJK — is
what matters.

### Wall time

~1 h end-to-end (embedding ~28 min; query phase ~30 min). Much
faster than v1's ~4 h because the query phase's BM25 leg was
actually returning hits instead of timing out through empty result
sets, so RRF fusion could terminate promptly. The jieba
preprocessing added ~0.3 s dictionary-load on first use and
negligible per-query / per-chunk overhead.

### Known issues / observations

**1. `retrieval.cjk_tokenizer: jieba` requires the `cjk` optional
extra.** Install with `uv sync --extra cjk`. Failing to install it
and flipping the config produces an `ImportError` on first CJK
preprocessing. No runtime regression for ASCII-only users who leave
`cjk_tokenizer: none`.

**2. The fix is locked at first ingest.** Existing CJK wikis that
were ingested under `unicode61` have `documents_fts` rows reflecting
per-char tokenization. Flipping `cjk_tokenizer: jieba` without
wiping `.dikw/index.sqlite` produces a mismatch between query-side
(jieba-segmented) and index-side (per-char) tokens, silently
dropping hits. Documented as gotcha #7 in `docs/providers.md`.

**3. Sampling caveat (unchanged from v1).** 5K-passage subset is
structurally easier than the full 118K corpus. Per-query retrieval
metrics read higher than leaderboard numbers — see the full caveat
in the v1 entry below. The BM25 fix does not change this subsampling
limitation.

### Follow-ups (priority-ordered)

1. **`--dump-raw` should key by query ID, not text.** Inherited
   from v1's follow-up list; still open. Datasets with duplicate
   query text silently lose queries in the dump.
2. **Full-corpus CMTEB run.** Now meaningful because BM25 is
   working. ~10× cost and time (~¥5 / ~10 h). Gate on whether we
   actually want to chase leaderboard parity.
3. **Score-normalised fusion (CombSUM / CombMNZ).** Same as v1 +
   SciFact v2 follow-ups; RRF is rank-based and may not beat
   vector-only on future datasets where one leg is much stronger.
4. **Japanese / Korean corpora.** jieba covers Chinese only.
   Japanese (MeCab) or Korean (MeCab-ko) would need additional
   tokenizer modes in `cjk_tokenizer`.

## 2026-04-24 — CMTEB / T2Retrieval (sampled, 300 queries)

**Status:** superseded by v2 above. Kept for historical reference —
the pre-jieba BM25 numbers are the fair comparison point for future
tokenizer work, and the known-issues section documents the root
cause the v2 patch addresses.

### Original context (unchanged below)

First real-vector run on Chinese. **BM25 leg unusable on
CJK with the current FTS5 tokenizer** — see "Known issues" #1. The
fusion-weight generalisation question that motivated this run
(BASELINES v2 follow-up) is therefore **deferred** to a re-run after
the CJK BM25 fix lands. What we *can* report from this run: vector
retrieval works strongly on Chinese, and the v2 fusion defaults
`(rrf_k=60, bm25_weight=0.3, vector_weight=1.5)` "trivially generalise"
in the sense that they correctly down-weight a useless BM25 leg
(equal-weight fusion only loses 0.003 nDCG@10).

### Why the corpus is sampled query-first, not stratified

Unlike BEIR/SciFact, **every T2Retrieval corpus passage is a positive
qrel for at least one query** (118,605 unique pids referenced =
118,605 corpus total). The generic stratified sampler in
`convert_cmteb.py` therefore degenerates — it preserves the relevant
set, which equals the whole corpus, so any `--sample-size` < 118,605
returns all 118,605 passages. Realistic calibration on this dataset
requires sampling **queries** first, then collecting their positive
pids and padding with distractors drawn from docs not referenced by
the sampled queries. `evals/tools/prep_cmteb_t2.py` implements this
pre-pass.

`hybrid` matches `vector` to four decimal places on every position-
weighted metric and on recall@100. RRF with `(0.3, 1.5)` against a
near-zero BM25 ranking effectively returns the vector ranking
unmodified — see Known issues #2.

Every top-tier configuration produces identical numbers because the
BM25 leg contributes essentially no signal — see Known issues #1.
Equal-weight only drops 0.003 nDCG@10 vs the shipped default; that
0.003 is the entire "fusion-weight tuning" surface area on this
dataset, and it's within re-run noise. **The fusion-weight
generalisation question is unanswerable on this dataset until BM25
on CJK is fixed.**

### Comparison vs published baselines

CMTEB leaderboard numbers shift over time and depend on the model
under test, so this dataset's `dataset.yaml` deliberately omits a
``published_baselines`` block. For reference at the time of writing,
modern Chinese embedders on the MTEB-CN leaderboard cluster around
nDCG@10 ≈ 0.85–0.93 on T2Retrieval (full corpus, 22,812 queries);
our 0.942 on the **300-query / 5K-corpus** subset is naturally above
that range because the smaller corpus reduces distractor density.
**Treat this number as a calibration floor for re-runs, not a
leaderboard comparison.**

For BM25 on CJK, the published Anserini-with-jieba baselines on
T2Retrieval sit around nDCG@10 ≈ 0.50–0.65 (model- and
configuration-dependent). Our **0.031** is two orders of magnitude
below that — see Known issues #1.

### Known issues / observations

**1. FTS5 BM25 is unusable on CJK with the current `unicode61`
tokenizer (P0 follow-up).** 275 of 300 queries (91.7%) returned
**zero** BM25 results; the remaining 25 mostly returned 1–6 hits, and
only 4 reached the top-100 limit. Diagnosis: SQLite FTS5's default
`unicode61` tokenizer treats CJK characters as single-character
tokens, and the `_sanitize_fts` rewrite path (added in commit
`62b596f` for the SciFact ablation) feeds those characters as
OR-of-tokens. Per-character BM25 has no useful signal for Chinese
passage retrieval — high-frequency characters dominate IDF, and
discriminating multi-character terms never form. The fix is a
CJK-aware tokenizer; SQLite's built-in `trigram` (3-character
n-grams) is the lowest-friction option, jieba+full-text is the
heaviest. This needs its own focused branch.

**2. Hybrid degenerates to vector-only when one leg is dead, and the
v2 default's `bm25_weight=0.3` makes that degeneration safe.** With
a noise-quality BM25 ranking, RRF at any `(k, weights)` returns
something proportional to the vector ranking; the `(0.3, 1.5)`
weighting accelerates this collapse and produces an identical
top-100 to vector-only mode. This is a small but real win for the
v2 defaults: a keyword-tuned default (e.g. equal-weight) would have
let BM25's noise leak into the fused ranking and lose 0.003 nDCG@10.
Not enough to matter here, but the directional behaviour generalises
from SciFact (where BM25 was real but ~0.10 nDCG@10 weaker than
vector — same shape, different magnitude).

**3. Vector retrieval is strong on Chinese.** Qwen3-Embedding-8B at
4096-dim hits hit@3=0.967 / nDCG@10=0.942 / recall@100=0.987 on
this subset. Wall-time and cost track SciFact (5,183 passages →
~28 min embedding; this run with 5,000 → similar). Confirms
docs/providers.md's recommendation that Qwen3 handles both languages
without per-corpus retuning.

**4. Sampling caveat for re-runs.** Per-query retrieval is structurally
easier on this subset than at full scale. Each sampled query has ~5
relevant docs on average (matches full-T2R's 5.2 qrels/query), but the
candidate pool shrinks from 118,605 → 5,000 — a single relevant doc is
~24× easier to surface by chance, and the same dense embedder will
land more of them in the top-10 / top-100 windows. Higher hit@k vs the
leaderboard is therefore structural, not a quality claim. The
leaderboard comparison only becomes meaningful after the BM25 fix lets
us actually exercise both legs — at which point we can also widen to
the full corpus if we're willing to spend ~¥10 / 10 hours embedding.

### Verdict on the original follow-up

> **Run CMTEB / T2Retrieval subset on the v2 defaults to confirm the
> weights generalise to Chinese + a different BM25/dense balance.**

Trivially yes (see above), but the test wasn't real — there was no
"different BM25/dense balance" to discover, only a broken BM25 leg
the v2 weights happened to silence cleanly. Real generalisation
verdict requires a re-run after the BM25 CJK fix.

### Follow-ups (priority-ordered)

1. **P0 — FTS5 CJK tokenizer.** Default `unicode61` doesn't segment
   CJK; switch to SQLite's built-in `trigram` (lowest friction, no
   new dep) or evaluate jieba-based segmentation. Schema change with
   a re-index migration path for existing wikis. Independent branch.
2. **After P0 — Re-run this baseline.** Same donor wiki, same
   sampling, same dump pipeline; should produce a non-trivial BM25
   leg whose nDCG@10 lands closer to the 0.50–0.65 published range,
   at which point the fusion-weight generalisation question becomes
   answerable.
3. **Score-normalised fusion (CombSUM / CombMNZ).** Same as in v2
   follow-ups; even after BM25 is fixed, RRF is rank-based and may
   not beat vector-only on datasets where the dense signal is much
   stronger than keyword. Independent branch.
4. **Optional — full-corpus run** for an apples-to-apples leaderboard
   comparison. ~10× the cost and time. Probably only worth it after
   #1 + #2 produce a credible single-corpus baseline.
5. **`eval/runner.py --dump-raw` should key by query ID, not text.**
   Surfaced by the final-verification codex review on this branch.
   `runner.py:323` writes only the query text into the dump JSONL;
   `evals/tools/sweep_rrf.py` then keys `per_dataset[ds][q]` by that
   string. Datasets with duplicate query text (rare on T2Retrieval,
   common on some public IR benchmarks) silently overwrite — sweep
   scores fewer queries than the real eval and may pick the wrong
   fusion weights. Add a stable query ID to the dump and key by it.
   Independent branch; touches eval runner + sweep_rrf in lockstep.

## 2026-04-23 — SciFact (BEIR) v2 — RRF tuned

**Status:** supersedes v1 as the canonical SciFact baseline. Same
embeddings, new fusion defaults.

### What changed from v1

v1 exposed a structural regression: equal-weight RRF at `k=60` let the
~0.10-nDCG-weaker BM25 leg drag hybrid 0.037 points below the
vector-only mode on nDCG@10. The fix, from BASELINES v1 follow-up #1,
landed in three layers:

1. `reciprocal_rank_fusion` grew a `weights` parameter (it had always
   been equal-weight).
2. `RetrievalConfig` in `dikw.yml` exposes `rrf_k` + `bm25_weight` +
   `vector_weight` so users can tune per-corpus.
3. `dikw eval --retrieval all --dump-raw` + `evals/tools/sweep_rrf.py`
   re-fuse a single dump at arbitrary weights offline — no re-embedding.

### Weight sweep (offline, same dump as v1)

Full 48-combination grid: `rrf_k ∈ {40, 60, 100}` × `bm25_weight ∈ {0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0}`
× `vector_weight ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0}`. Top 5 by nDCG@10 plus the
vanilla and shipped-default reference rows:

```

Full grid + commentary in `/tmp/sweep-result.log` on the run host.

### Shipped defaults: `(rrf_k=60, bm25_weight=0.3, vector_weight=1.5)`

Why this point and not the grid top:

- **Keep `k=60` unchanged.** It's the original RRF-paper constant and
  what every downstream user's mental model pins on. `k=40` scores
  0.002 higher on SciFact — within noise, and the flatter `k=60` curve
  across the grid suggests it generalises better to other corpora.
- **Closest "k=60" row to the Pareto top.** Tiers at `w_bm25=0.3` all
  collapse to ~0.771 nDCG@10; picking a more moderate `w_bm25=0.5` or
  `0.7` loses 0.004–0.011 nDCG@10 for arguably less overfit but
  weakens the SciFact win we actually measured.
- **Recall@100 unchanged at 0.970.** Every top-tier config keeps this
  — the BM25 leg's recall contribution is invariant to its weight; only
  position-weighted metrics shift.

Hybrid now effectively **ties vector on every position-weighted metric
within re-run noise** (Δ ≤ 0.004), while keeping the BM25 leg's
recall@100 advantage (+0.023 over vector). The v1 regression ("hybrid
< vector on nDCG@10") is resolved.

### Comparison vs published baselines (unchanged from v1)

| Metric | Our bm25 | Published (BEIR paper, BM25 Anserini) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| nDCG@10 | **0.669** | **0.665** | **+0.004** |

The BM25 leg is untouched by fusion tuning; the Anserini calibration
stays as before.

### Caveat: SciFact-tuned default is vector-heavy

The `(0.3, 1.5)` ratio over-favours dense semantics. On a
**keyword-heavy corpus** (code, identifiers, exact-term lookup) this
default will under-rank BM25 hits — raise `bm25_weight` in
`dikw.yml`'s `retrieval:` block. The `evals/tools/sweep_rrf.py` flow
is the intended tuning path; it finishes in milliseconds against a
`--dump-raw` JSONL, no second API call.

### Follow-ups (still not this PR)

- **Run CMTEB / T2Retrieval subset** on the v2 defaults to confirm the
  weights generalise to Chinese + a different BM25/dense balance.
- **Sweep chunk size** (450 / 900 / 1800 tokens) on SciFact. The
  default is picked by feel, not measured.
- **Score-normalized fusion** (CombSUM / CombMNZ) — the v2 tuning
  basically tied vector; going *above* it likely requires fusion that
  honours score magnitude, not just rank position. Independent branch,
  not blocked on anything above.

## 2026-04-23 — SciFact (BEIR)

**Status:** superseded by v2 above (same embeddings, equal-weight
fusion). Kept for historical reference — the pre-tuning numbers are
the fair comparison point for any future fusion work.

### Comparison vs published baselines

| Metric | Our bm25 | Published (BEIR paper, BM25 Anserini) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| nDCG@10 | **0.669** | **0.665** | **+0.004** |

Within 0.004 of the published number — **FTS5 BM25 is functionally
equivalent to Anserini BM25 on SciFact** once the sanitizer tokenizes
correctly. This tightens `docs/eval-plan.md` caveat #2 ("FTS5 ≠
Anserini"); the algorithmic difference is below-noise on this dataset.

Dense retrieval in the original BEIR paper spans 0.48 – 0.67 nDCG@10
depending on the model (DPR, ANCE, GenQ, TAS-B, ColBERT). Our vector
leg at 0.773 is consistent with modern state-of-the-art embedders
(Qwen3, BGE-M3, E5-mistral family), which sit above the 2021 numbers.

### Known issues / observations

**1. Hybrid underperforms vector (regression risk).** On SciFact,
dense-only retrieval (`vector` mode) beats hybrid by +0.037 nDCG@10
and +0.024 hit@10. RRF with `k=60` gives equal weight to both legs;
because bm25 is ~0.10 nDCG@10 behind vector, averaging pulls the
ranking toward the weaker signal. Hybrid still wins on **recall@100
(0.970 vs 0.947)** — the bm25 leg covers docs vector misses, just at
ranks too low to help the position-weighted metrics.

This confirms `docs/eval-plan.md` caveat #3 ("RRF k=60 never tuned").
Not a blocker for this PR — the ablation surfacing the problem is
exactly what the new `--retrieval all` flag was built for — but the
**default behaviour of `dikw query` is currently suboptimal on
paraphrased / synonym-heavy queries where one leg dominates**.

**2. Real-embedder wall time dominates (~80 min for 5K corpus).** Most
of it is the 324 embedding batches at ~5 s each (Gitee AI latency
scales with output dim; 4096-dim is large). Using 1024-dim matryoshka
truncation would cut cost and time ~4×, at the quality cost of
roughly -0.02 nDCG@10 on Qwen3 (rule-of-thumb from matryoshka papers;
not measured here). Tradeoff to revisit if we ever want to run this
in CI — presently it stays manual.

**3. Chunking was not a factor.** SciFact passages median ~200 tokens;
no doc fragmented at the 900-token chunk boundary. Caveat #1 in
`docs/eval-plan.md` is effectively dormant for BEIR-scale corpora and
will only bite on CMTEB where passages routinely exceed 900 tokens.

### Follow-ups (not this PR)

Priority-ordered. Each is a self-contained piece of work; do not bundle.

- **Fix RRF weighting.** Two flavors worth trying, in order: (a)
  per-dataset tunable `RRF_K` / mode weights via `dikw.yml` — small,
  lets the user discover the right ratio per corpus; (b) score-
  normalized fusion (CombSUM / CombMNZ over min-max scaled scores) —
  more complex but solves the problem generally. Gate on whether (a)
  moves the SciFact hybrid number above vector.
- **Calibrate thresholds per-dataset after (a).** Thresholds currently
  track hybrid-as-canonical; if hybrid gets stronger, raise the floors.
- **Fix the dataset.yaml overwrite regression.** `convert_beir.py`
  always rewrites the file, stripping any curated description. Should
  merge into the existing stub (preserve user keys, only rewrite the
  block the converter owns).
- **Run CMTEB / T2Retrieval subset** against the same donor wiki —
  same Qwen3 embedder handles both languages; result shape should be
  similar but with 900-token chunking actually biting.
- **Sweep chunk size** (450 / 900 / 1800 tokens) on SciFact — the
  default is picked by feel, not measured. Might recover part of the
  hybrid gap if shorter chunks localise BM25 signal better.
