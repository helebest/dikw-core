"""LLM judge for K-layer synth output.

The soft layer of the spec's "hard gate + soft judge" pair. Each page
gets one ``llm.complete`` call with the ``eval_judge_synth`` prompt;
the model returns four 0-5 integer scores plus a one-line rationale.
Per-page parse failures are counted (``n_errors``) rather than raised
so one bad response doesn't kill the whole eval.

Results never block a PR — they go into ``BASELINES.md`` as the
quality trend the author watches when tuning ``synthesize.md``.
