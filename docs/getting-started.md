# Getting started

This walkthrough takes a blank directory to a queryable knowledge base with a
curated Wisdom layer in about five minutes. It only needs Python 3.12+ and
`uv`; LLM keys are optional until you hit `dikw synth` or `dikw distill`
(the engine-internal authoring legs). Plain `dikw client retrieve` runs
without any LLM key.

## 1. Install and scaffold

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helebest/dikw-core
cd dikw-core
uv sync

# Pick any directory — `my-base/` below — it will also be a valid Obsidian vault.
uv run dikw init ../my-base --description "my research base"
cd ../my-base
```

The init command creates this tree:

```text
my-base/
├── dikw.yml              # the config the engine reads on every command
├── sources/              # your raw documents go here (Data layer)
├── wiki/                 # LLM-authored knowledge pages, regenerated on synth
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── log.md
│   └── {entities,concepts,notes}/
├── wisdom/               # principles / lessons / patterns (LLM proposes, you approve)
│   ├── principles.md
│   ├── lessons.md
│   ├── patterns.md
│   └── _candidates/
└── .dikw/                # engine state (gitignored)
    └── index.sqlite
```

The whole tree is the **dikw base**; the `wiki/` subdirectory is just
the K-layer slice. Open the folder in Obsidian and you'll see the wiki +
wisdom pages render natively thanks to the `[[wikilink]]` syntax and
YAML front-matter the engine emits.

## 2. Start the server

`dikw-core` runs as a long-lived process; the CLI is a thin client that
talks HTTP + NDJSON to it. Start the server bound to your base in a
spare terminal (or under a process supervisor):

```bash
uv run dikw serve --base .
# bound to http://127.0.0.1:8765 — no auth on loopback
```

Leave it running. Every `dikw <op>` shown below is a top-level alias for
`dikw client <op>` and routes through this server.

## 3. Add source material and ingest

Two steps:

* **Import** — pre-flight + ship markdown packages (each md plus the
  assets it embeds) from a local directory into the server's
  `<base>/sources/` tree.
* **Ingest** — chunk + FTS-index + (optionally) embed whatever lives
  under `<base>/sources/`.

```bash
# Import your local notes (file or directory) into the base. Each *.md
# becomes one package together with the images it references; the
# pre-flight rejects bad frontmatter, missing assets, and orphan
# files BEFORE the network round trip. ``import`` commits the bytes
# into ``<base>/sources/``; it does NOT chunk or embed.
uv run dikw import ./my-notes

# ``ingest`` is the next step: scans ``<base>/sources/``, chunks the
# markdown, and writes the D/I layer. Offline mode indexes FTS only,
# no API calls.
uv run dikw ingest --no-embed

# Or with embeddings (requires DIKW_EMBEDDING_API_KEY on any OpenAI-compatible
# endpoint — OpenAI, Gitee AI, Ollama, vLLM, …).
export DIKW_EMBEDDING_API_KEY=sk-...
uv run dikw ingest
```

`import` and `ingest` are two halves of one user intent: import handles
**outside the base** → `sources/`; ingest handles `sources/` →
**chunks + embeddings**. If the server runs on the same machine as your
notes, you can also drop / edit markdown directly under
`<base>/sources/` and skip `dikw import` — `dikw ingest` always scans
whatever's on disk.

`dikw status --format table` shows document, chunk, and embedding counts
per DIKW layer in a human-readable table. The default `dikw status`
output is JSON so an automation script or agent can pipe it into `jq`
without extra flags. Subsequent ingests are idempotent: files whose
content hash hasn't changed are skipped.

## 4. Retrieve grounded chunks (Information layer)

```bash
uv run dikw client retrieve "What does Karpathy mean by deterministic scoping?" --format table
```

Returns the top-K chunks (with full text, path, layer, and score) plus
page-level refs. `--format table` renders the hits as a human-readable
table. For piping into `jq` or an agent loop, use
`dikw client retrieve "..." --plain` so the rich "retrieving…" status
line stays off stdout; that combination emits just the final JSON
payload.

**dikw-core does not produce the final answer itself.** Answer synthesis
— composing chunks into prose with a particular style, applying query
rewrite or conversation context — belongs in the agent layer (Claude
Code, ChatGPT, your own script). Pipe the retrieve JSON into your LLM of
choice and let it draft the answer with whatever prompt fits your task.

## 5. Synthesise a Knowledge layer

```bash
uv run dikw synth
```

The LLM reads each source doc and produces a `wiki/<folder>/<slug>.md`
page, cross-linked via `[[wikilinks]]`. `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md`
regenerate automatically. Re-running is a no-op until you add new sources
(or pass `--all` to resynthesise everything).

Run `dikw lint` to check for broken wikilinks, orphans, and duplicate titles.

### Watching synth progress on large sources

A long source (a book-sized markdown) is split into multiple LLM calls
under the hood. The client streams two layers of progress events:

- `phase="synth"` — outer counter, advances once per source (`2/43`).
- `phase="synth_llm"` — inner counter, fires `status="calling"` before
  each LLM round-trip and `status="returned"` after, so you can tell a
  slow LLM call apart from a deadlock. A parser failure surfaces as
  `status="error"` with `error_kind` / `error_msg` fields.

If a single source freezes for minutes without inner events you're
either looking at a provider stall (codex SSE keepalive bug, gateway
buffering) or a real network hang — not a synth-loop issue.

For server-side detail, raise the log level on the server process:

```bash
DIKW_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG dikw serve --base $DIKW_BASE
```

DEBUG adds a per-group log line on each side of the LLM call (model,
section count, response chars). A parser failure surfaces at WARNING
even at the default INFO level — operators tailing the server don't
need DEBUG to spot one.

## 6. Distil Wisdom (the W layer)

```bash
uv run dikw distill
uv run dikw review list
uv run dikw review approve W-abcdef123456
```

`distill` prompts the LLM for principles/lessons/patterns supported by **at
least two pieces of evidence** across the wiki. Approval deletes the
candidate file, promotes the item to approved status, and regenerates
`wisdom/<kind>s.md`. Rejected items are archived.

Approved wisdom is exposed to agents through `GET /v1/wisdom/applicable?q=...`
(once PR-5 lands). Until then, list active items by hitting the existing
`GET /v1/wisdom?status=approved` HTTP endpoint and inject them into your
own LLM prompt — dikw-core no longer ships an in-engine query path that
auto-injects them.

## 7. Check retrieval quality on your corpus

```bash
# Default: run all packaged datasets (ships with the MVP dogfood corpus).
uv run dikw eval

# Run against your own corpus: create a 3-file directory and point at it.
uv run dikw eval --dataset ./my-corpus/
```

Each query is marked a "hit" at top-k if any `expect_any` doc stem is in
the top-k result. Metrics: `hit@3`, `hit@10`, `MRR`. Exit code 0/1/2.

The full convention (what `dataset.yaml` looks like, how to author
queries, how to convert public benchmarks) lives in [`evals/README.md`](../evals/README.md).

## 8. Bind the server to a non-loopback interface

`dikw serve --host 0.0.0.0` is rejected unless `DIKW_SERVER_TOKEN` is set
— the runtime refuses to expose an unauthenticated base to the network.
Run with the token:

```bash
export DIKW_SERVER_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
uv run dikw serve --base . --host 0.0.0.0
```

Clients pick the same token up via `DIKW_SERVER_TOKEN` (or `--token` /
`~/.config/dikw/client.toml`) and pass it as a bearer header.

## Pluggable providers

Edit `dikw.yml` to swap LLM or embedding providers without changing code:

```yaml
provider:
  llm: openai_compat           # anthropic_compat | openai_compat (protocol names)
  llm_model: gpt-4.1-mini
  llm_base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1   # Ollama, vLLM, Azure, …
  embedding: openai_compat
  embedding_model: text-embedding-3-small
  embedding_base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
  embedding_dim: 1536          # required: must match what the endpoint returns
  embedding_revision: ""       # bump to force re-embed when vendor refreshes weights silently
  embedding_normalize: true
  embedding_distance: cosine
```

`llm` is a **protocol** name (which SDK to speak), not a vendor name.
`llm_base_url` works for both `anthropic_compat` and `openai_compat`. With
`llm: anthropic_compat` it retargets the official `anthropic` SDK at any
Anthropic-protocol-compatible endpoint (e.g., MiniMax's
`https://api.minimaxi.com/anthropic`), keeping the `cache_control` benefit
on the system prompt.

For a per-vendor config cookbook (MiniMax, GLM, Gemini, DeepSeek,
Gitee AI, Ollama, …), a pre-flight checklist, and the production
gotchas around batch size, embedding dimensions, retries, and prompt
caching, see [`providers.md`](./providers.md).

### Example: MiniMax LLM + Gitee AI embeddings

MiniMax has no embeddings endpoint — pair it with an OpenAI-compatible
embedding vendor. The example below uses Gitee AI's `Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`
(1024 native, the recommended default; swap in `Qwen3-Embedding-8B` with
`embedding_dim: 1024` matryoshka or `4096` native for higher-cost runs).
dikw-core never auto-detects vendor URLs — fill these in by hand:

```yaml
provider:
  llm: anthropic_compat
  llm_model: <MiniMax Anthropic-compatible model name>
  llm_base_url: https://api.minimaxi.com/anthropic
  embedding: openai_compat
  embedding_model: Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
  embedding_base_url: https://ai.gitee.com/v1
  embedding_dim: 1024               # 0.6B native; locked at first ingest
  embedding_revision: ""            # bump to force re-embed when Qwen weights drift silently
  embedding_normalize: true
  embedding_distance: cosine
  embedding_batch_size: 16          # required: Gitee rejects batches >25
  embedding_provider_label: gitee-ai  # optional; shows up in `dikw check`
```

A working reference copy lives at
[`tests/fixtures/live-minimax-gitee.dikw.yml`](../tests/fixtures/live-minimax-gitee.dikw.yml)
— drop it into a fresh base and fill in your two keys.

The two legs use **distinct keys**. The embedding leg reads
`DIKW_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` exclusively — no fallback to `OPENAI_API_KEY` — so
misconfig fails loudly instead of cross-wiring credentials:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-MiniMax-key>
export DIKW_EMBEDDING_API_KEY=<your-Gitee-key>
```

Or copy [`.env.example`](../.env.example) → `.env` (gitignored) and fill
it in. `.env` holds **secrets only** — all non-secret config (endpoint
URLs, model names, dimensions, batch size, display label) lives in
`dikw.yml`. `pytest-dotenv` auto-loads `.env` for the test suite; for
`dikw` CLI calls either `source` it (`set -a; source .env; set +a`) or
use `uv run --env-file .env dikw …`.

### Verify your provider config

After editing `dikw.yml` and exporting the env vars, run:

```bash
uv run dikw check --format table --llm-only    # just LLM (human-readable)
uv run dikw check --format table --embed-only  # just embedding
uv run dikw check --format table               # both legs
```

Each variant pings the relevant provider with one tiny request and
reports endpoint / latency / dim/tokens. Drop `--format table` to get
the raw JSON probe report (default, agent-friendly). Exit code is 0 on
success, 1 on any probe failure, 2 when `--llm-only` and `--embed-only`
are passed together. Do this *before* running `dikw ingest` on a real
corpus so a misconfigured endpoint doesn't burn a full embedding run.

## Pluggable storage

Two backends ship; switch by editing `storage.backend` in `dikw.yml`:

```yaml
storage:
  backend: sqlite                     # default
  path: .dikw/index.sqlite
```

Enterprise / multi-user via Postgres (requires `pip install dikw-core[postgres]`
and a database with the `vector` extension):

```yaml
storage:
  backend: postgres
  dsn: postgresql://user:pw@host:5432/dikw
  schema: dikw
  pool_size: 10
```

Both backends implement the same `Storage` Protocol, so every `dikw`
command behaves identically regardless of which one is active.
