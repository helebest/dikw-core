"""Fixer for ``non_atomic_page`` issues.

Stage A's atomicity rule says one wiki page = one self-contained idea
or entity. The lint scanner flags pages whose body, H1/H2 count, or
distinct-wikilink count signals "this is N pages glued together"; this
fixer asks the synth LLM to split the body into atomic children.

The fixer is **LLM-only** — there is no useful pure-heuristic split.
It short-circuits to ``None`` when ``ctx.enable_llm`` is False,
``ctx.llm`` / ``ctx.cfg`` is missing, the body is too large to feed
safely (see :data:`MAX_SPLIT_BODY_BYTES`), or the call yields fewer
than two children.

External wikilinks pointing at the original page are intentionally
**not** rewritten. Once the original is deleted, sibling pages with
``[[Original Title]]`` links surface as ``broken_wikilink`` issues
under the next lint pass, where the broken_wikilink fixer (with
``--enable-llm`` for stub fallback if needed) handles them. Keeping
this fixer's scope narrow avoids the embedding-similarity machinery
needed to pick the "right" child for each external referrer.
