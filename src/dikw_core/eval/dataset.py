"""Dataset loading — convention-over-configuration.

A dataset is a directory with up to **five** entries:

  <dataset>/
    dataset.yaml     — name, description, thresholds (optionally namespaced
                       as ``<view>/<metric>``), modes, synth + judge config.
    corpus/*.md      — documents to ingest; image files referenced via
                       ``![](path)`` live in ``corpus/`` too (any
                       sub-directory layout is fine).
    targets.yaml     — *(optional)* assets + chunks named-id catalog. When
                       present, queries can express chunk-level / asset-level
                       ground truth via ``expect_chunk_any`` /
                       ``expect_asset_any``. Absent → only doc-level eval.
    queries.yaml     — list of {q, expect_*_any | expect_none} entries.
    expected.yaml    — *(optional, synth mode only)* per-source expected
                       page titles + informational keywords for
                       ``expected_coverage`` / report enrichment. Absent →
                       ``expected_coverage`` metric not computed.

``load_dataset(name_or_path)`` accepts either a registered name (looked up
under ``datasets_root()``) or a directory path (user-provided). No registry
file, no plugin system: the filesystem layout *is* the contract.

    Plain retrieval keys (``hit_at_3``) gate on the canonical doc view
    (back-compat). Namespaced keys (``chunk/hit_at_3``, ``asset/hit_at_10``)
    gate on the corresponding granularity view; the runner mirrors the
    canonical doc view's plain key for both ``hit_at_3`` and
    ``doc/hit_at_3`` so existing dataset.yaml files keep gating without
    modification.

    K-layer metrics MUST use the ``synth/<metric>`` namespace; bare
    synth metric names and retrieval metrics under ``synth/`` are both
    rejected here so the load is the single source of "which family
    this gate belongs to". Otherwise ``run_synth_eval`` would silently
    drop bare synth thresholds (its filter only keeps ``synth/*``) and
    ``check_thresholds`` would record a never-computable miss for keys
    like ``synth/hit_at_3``.
