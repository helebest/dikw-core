"""Schema version fingerprint shared by SQL adapters.

Pre-alpha policy is "rebuild on incompatibility": each adapter ships a
single ``schema.sql`` representing the desired shape, and ``migrate()``
either applies it to a fresh DB or refuses to touch a DB whose stored
fingerprint doesn't match the code's expected ``SCHEMA_VERSION``. There
is no in-place upgrade path; the user is told to rebuild.

Bump ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` whenever a breaking schema change lands. The
number is opaque — only equality matters.

The key the fingerprint is stored under (``SCHEMA_VERSION_KEY``) is
**deliberately distinct from the legacy ``schema_version`` key written
by the deleted per-migration-file counter**. A pre-fingerprint install
still has a ``meta_kv['schema_version']`` row carrying its old counter
value (1, 2, or 3), but the new code never reads that key — it sees
``None`` under ``schema_fingerprint`` instead and routes to the
fresh-DB branch in ``migrate()``, which then loud-fails on the
documents-table check (``_REBUILD_HINT`` per adapter). No risk of a
collision where an old counter value compares equal to the new
fingerprint.
