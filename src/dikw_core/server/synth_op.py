"""Synth + distill task wiring.

These ops mirror ``ingest_op.make_ingest_runner``: build a
``TaskRunner`` closure that ``TaskManager.submit`` schedules. Each runner
owns its own provider clients (LLM, optional embedder) for the duration
of the task and returns a JSON-serialisable result dict that the manager
folds into the ``final`` event.

Synth + distill share the same provider-failure mode: a missing
``OPENAI_API_KEY`` / ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` surfaces as a runner-level
``BadRequest``, so the task ends ``failed`` with a clear cause instead of
a partially-progressed terminal that hid the misconfiguration.
