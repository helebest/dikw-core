"""Per-process engine handle: cfg / wiki root / storage / task subsystem.

One ``ServerRuntime`` is built at server startup and torn down at shutdown;
route handlers reach it via FastAPI dependencies. We keep this small —
just the long-lived state — because the engine itself is largely stateless
(LLM / embedding providers are built per-request as today).

Lifecycle:
  startup  →  load cfg, build storage, connect, migrate,
              build task store + manager, restart_cleanup
  shutdown →  manager.shutdown, store.close, task_store.close

         at different paths in different containers, which a
         path-hash scheme cannot.
      3. Generate a fresh UUID4, write it to (2), return it.

    A path-based hash was the previous scheme but broke whenever two

    every cross-replica read filtered under a different scope and the
