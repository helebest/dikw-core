# Changelog

All notable changes to `dikw-core` are tracked here. The project is
**pre-alpha** and follows [SemVer](https://semver.org) loosely — until
1.0, breaking changes can land in any minor version. The status notes
on each entry call out exactly what shape changes break.

## Unreleased

### `synth` — preserve dominant source language in K-layer pages

* **Changed**: synth prompt (`prompts/synthesize.md`) gains an `## Output
  language` section that instructs the LLM to detect the dominant language
  of the SOURCE DOCUMENT and emit page titles, body H1, body paragraphs,
  tags, and **new** wikilink titles in that same language. Chinese sources
  no longer get translated into English K-pages by default; English sources
  remain unchanged.
* **Changed**: `DEFAULT_SYNTH_SYSTEM` (`domains/knowledge/synthesize.py`)
  now reinforces the same rule as a second-line defence — keeps the
  directive in scope when the user prompt is later truncated under
  context-window pressure. The split `non_atomic_page` lint fixer reuses
  this constant, so its in-place page splits inherit the language rule
  for free.
* **Invariant kept**: `path` and `slug` remain lowercase ASCII kebab-case
  regardless of title language — Obsidian / cross-OS portability of the
  on-disk wiki tree depends on it. For non-ASCII titles the LLM is
  instructed to use a short pinyin or English-equivalent slug; the title
  itself stays in the source language.
* **Tests**: new `test_synth_prompt_preserves_source_language` in
  `tests/test_synthesize_pipeline.py` asserts both the user-prompt template
  and the `DEFAULT_SYNTH_SYSTEM` system prompt carry the rule end-to-end.
* **Out of scope**: `distill` and `query` prompts are NOT yet language-aware
  — Chinese K-pages still risk producing English wisdom and English answers.
  Tracked separately.

### `lint apply` — storage-sync closure + CJK / cross-link correctness

* **Fixed**: `dikw lint apply` for `create_page` ops now registers the
  new K page in storage (document row + chunks + outgoing links)
  instead of just writing the file to disk. Before this fix, a
  freshly-created stub showed up on disk but was invisible to the
  next `run_lint` (which builds its title map from
  `storage.list_documents`) — so users saw the same `broken_wikilink`
  reported again and assumed apply did nothing. There is no separate
  ingest path that closes the gap; lint apply has to do it itself.
* **Fixed**: `lint apply` now reconciles outgoing wikilinks on the
  *referrer* page (the source page that contained the broken
  `[[Title]]`), not just on the page the proposal mutated. Without
  this, a `broken_wikilink → create_page` LLM stub fix would land a
  new K page that `run_lint` immediately reported as `orphan_page`
  because `storage.links_from(source)` was stale.
* **Fixed**: intra-batch cross-links resolve in a single apply pass.
  `non_atomic_page` splits that emit Topic A + Topic B (where A's
  body links to `[[Topic B]]`) used to silently drop A→B because
  `paths_changed` iterated alphabetically — A persisted before B's
  title entered the resolver index. Phase 0 now pre-populates
  `title_to_path` from `op.new_frontmatter` before any persist call
  runs.
* **Fixed**: `BrokenWikilinkFixer` now lets short CJK targets
  (`[[秦朝]]`, `[[疫苗]]`, `[[抗体]]`) reach the LLM stub fallback
  when `--enable-llm` is set. The 4-char heuristic gate (a guard
  against 3-char ASCII substring noise) was applied at the top of
  `propose()` instead of inside the heuristic branch, so 2-3 char
  Chinese entity titles were silently dropped before the LLM path
  could fire — exactly the case Chinese wiki users hit most.
* **Fixed**: `lint apply` now threads the configured
  `retrieval.cjk_tokenizer` (default `jieba`) through to the
  K-layer indexer. Before, lint-apply chunks were always split with
  the no-op `none` tokenizer, diverging from the `doc.hash`
  lint-apply itself wrote and breaking the next embedding backfill
  on Chinese content.
* **Refactored**: K-layer page indexing (document upsert + chunks +
  embeddings + outgoing-link reconciliation) now lives in a single
  `domains/knowledge/page_index.persist_wiki_page` shared by synth
  and lint apply. The function takes `(path, title=None)` and reads
  title fallbacks from disk, so callers don't double-parse the file.
  `wiki.path_slug_title` centralises the path-stem-to-title
  convention previously duplicated in three places.
* **Apply contract**: `_op_title` is the single source of truth for
  "what title should this op produce" — phase 0's resolver index and
  `_build_page_from_op`'s `WikiPage` construction now compute the
  same value (raw frontmatter title stripped of leading/trailing
  whitespace, falling back to `path_slug_title` when missing or
  non-string), so a fixer that omits `title` in `new_frontmatter`
  still gets sibling links resolved correctly.

### Upload decoupled from ingest — new `dikw client upload` command

* **BREAKING**: `dikw client ingest --from <dir>` is removed. Upload
  is now a separate command (see below); `dikw client ingest` only
  scans the server's existing `<base>/sources/` tree.
* **BREAKING**: `POST /v1/ingest` no longer accepts an `upload_id`
  field (`extra="forbid"` rejects it). `commit_staging` and the old
  upload→ingest chain in `server/ingest_op.py` are deleted.
* **BREAKING**: `POST /v1/upload/sources` manifest schema upgrades
  to `{"files": [...], "packages": [...], "total_bytes": N}`. The
  legacy files-only shape returns `manifest_packages_missing`.
  Response gains `committed: list[int]` + `rejected: list[{id, code,
  detail}]`; the legacy `staging_path` field is removed.
* **Added**: `dikw client upload <path>` (top-level alias `dikw upload
  <path>`) — accepts a single `.md` file or a directory whose
  `**/*.md` becomes one package each. Pre-flight inspection
  (frontmatter parse, asset-existence, non-empty body, orphan-asset)
  runs locally; failures exit 2 before the network round trip.
* **Added**: `src/dikw_core/md_inspect.py` — shared module exposing
  `extract_image_refs(body)` and `inspect_markdown(path, *,
  project_root)`. The D-layer `domains/data/backends/markdown.py`
  re-exports `extract_image_refs` so existing callers stay intact.
* **Added**: per-package commit semantics — server validates each
  package's `package_sha256 = sha256(sorted([md_sha, *asset_shas])
  .join("\n"))`, commits the well-formed packages straight into
  `<base>/sources/` via `os.replace`, and reports failed packages
  via `rejected` (still 200, so partial successes don't force a
  retry of the whole batch).
* **Added**: server-startup orphan-staging cleanup —
  `<base>/.dikw/upload-staging/*` is wiped on `build_runtime` to
  cover crash-recovery (a `finally` rmtree in the upload route
  handles the normal path).
* **Added**: server error codes `manifest_packages_missing`,
  `manifest_orphan_file`, `manifest_duplicate_md_path`,
  `manifest_package_unknown_file`, `manifest_package_sha256_mismatch`,
  `package_commit_failed`.
* **Tightened**: tar `_ALLOWED_TOP_DIRS` reduced to `("sources",)`
  — assets ride along under `sources/<rel>` to preserve sibling-of-md
  asset resolution; `assets/` as a top-level archive directory is no
  longer accepted.

### `lint propose` / `lint apply` — repair closure for broken_wikilink

* **Added**: `dikw client lint propose [--rule <kind>] [--limit N]` runs lint
  + dispatches per-rule fixers, collecting structured `FixProposal`s.
  Result lives in the existing `tasks.result` JSON column — no new
  storage layer, no Storage Protocol changes.
* **Added**: `dikw client lint apply <proposal-task-id> [--pick a,b] [--skip c]`
  reads a successful propose task's result, validates each
  `expected_hash` against the on-disk file (concurrent-edit guard),
  mutates `wiki/` via `wiki.write_page` / unlink, and reconciles
  outgoing wikilinks via `storage.replace_links_from`.
* **Added**: `dikw client lint proposals` lists succeeded propose tasks
  with proposal counts and an "applied?" derived field.
* **Added**: `BrokenWikilinkFixer` — heuristic-only path. Normalizes the
  broken target with Unicode-aware `\w` (CJK / Cyrillic / Greek work,
  not just ASCII), fuzzy-matches existing K-layer titles via
  `difflib.SequenceMatcher`, proposes an in-place `[[link]]` rewrite
  when the ratio crosses 0.85. Targets that the engine's own
  `resolve_links` fuzzy stage would already handle never reach this
  fixer — it covers the typo / edit-distance cases beyond the
  engine's deterministic normalize.
* **Apply safety**: paths are sandboxed under `<base>/wiki/` (rejects
  absolute paths, `..` traversal, and base-relative targets like
  `sources/foo.md`); `update_page` / `delete_page` ops require a
  non-empty `expected_hash`; multiple ops on the same path within one
  apply pass are detected and the second one skipped with an explicit
  "superseded" reason rather than a misleading hash mismatch.
* **Apply contract**: only `lint.propose` task results are accepted as
  proposal sources — passing an unrelated SUCCEEDED task id surfaces
  as `proposal_wrong_op` instead of silently no-op'ing on an empty
  proposal report.
* **Followups**: PR2 plans an LLM stub-page fallback for
  `broken_wikilink` misses + a `non_atomic_page` fixer that reuses
  the synth 1:N fan-out; PR3 adds `orphan_page` + `duplicate_title`
  fixers.

### `lint propose` / `lint apply` — PR2: LLM stub fallback + non_atomic_page splitter

* **Added**: `dikw client lint propose --enable-llm` opts the configured
  LLM into the per-rule fixers. Default off — heuristic-only propose
  stays free of token spend; users opt in explicitly because each
  issue may incur a real LLM call.
* **Added**: `BrokenWikilinkFixer` LLM stub fallback. When the
  fuzzy-match heuristic misses, the fixer asks the LLM to draft a
  stub page (matching title + TODO marker, no invented facts) so the
  wikilink resolves on the next lint pass. Refuses to overwrite
  existing K-pages and strips Obsidian alias / anchor syntax from
  the broken target so `[[X|alias]]` and `[[X#section]]` resolve to
  the bare `X` title the resolver expects.
* **Added**: `NonAtomicPageFixer` — splits a page flagged as
  non-atomic into N atomic children + delete the original.
  LLM-only (no heuristic; `--enable-llm` required). External
  wikilinks pointing at the original are intentionally NOT rewritten
  — the next lint pass surfaces them as `broken_wikilink` issues
  that the stub fallback / fuzzy match handles.
* **Added**: `synthesize_pages_from_text` shared helper in
  `domains/knowledge/synthesize.py` and `safe_synthesize_pages`
  wrapper in `domains/knowledge/lint_fix.py` — single seam for
  "text → N pages" used by both the LLM-stub and split fixers.
  Handles `SynthesisPartialError` with a `strict=True` mode for
  destructive callers (refuse any partial parse) vs `strict=False`
  for additive callers (return parsed pages).
* **Apply atomicity**: `run_lint_apply` now preflights every op of
  every proposal against current disk state (collisions, missing
  files, hash drift, sandbox refusal). If ANY op would fail, the
  whole proposal skips at op #0 — no half-applied state on disk.
  A multi-op proposal where create_page #1 succeeds and create_page
  #2 collides used to leave child #1 orphaned + the original still
  present; preflight closes that gap.
* **Safety guards**:
  - `non_atomic_page` skips bodies > 32 KB to avoid the openai_codex
    SSE keepalive timeout on very large prompts.
  - `non_atomic_page` uses its own 16-child ceiling (decoupled from
    `cfg.synth.max_pages_per_group`) and refuses any split where the
    LLM emitted exactly the ceiling — the model voluntarily stops at
    the cap with no truncation signal, so we can't tell whether
    topic 17 just didn't exist or got dropped silently.
  - `safe_synthesize_pages` returns `None` on `retry=True` partials
    (`max_tokens` truncation — recoverable next run with a bigger
    budget) regardless of caller mode.
  - Both LLM fixers refuse `create_page` paths that collide with
    existing K-pages; the split fixer aborts the entire proposal on
    any child collision rather than silently dropping the colliding
    child's content.
* **Followups**: PR3 still owes `orphan_page` + `duplicate_title`
  fixers per the original lint-fix closure plan.

### Agent ergonomics + `--wiki` → `--base` rename

* **BREAKING**: `dikw serve --wiki <path>` is now `dikw serve --base <path>`
  (and `dikw client serve-and-run --wiki` → `--base`). The old flag is
  removed; pre-alpha rebuild policy applies. The on-disk `wiki/`
  subdirectory keeps its name — only the CLI flag pointing at the
  bound directory changed, since "base" is the consistent term for the
  whole tree (containing `sources/`, `wiki/`, `wisdom/`, `.dikw/`,
  `dikw.yml`).
* **Added**: `--format json|table` on `status`, `lint`, `tasks list`,
  `review list` — same contract as `health`, `retrieve`, `pages list`.
  JSON output is unbuffered, suitable for piping into `jq` or feeding
  back into an agent loop.
* **Added**: `--help` epilogs with example invocations on `serve`,
  `init`, `health`, `check`, `retrieve`, `query`, `ingest`, `pages
  list`, `pages get`.
* **Added**: top-level `AGENTS.md` and `INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md` for AI
  agents that *use* dikw-core as a knowledge backend (vs. CLAUDE.md
  which targets coding assistants contributing to the engine).

### **BREAKING**: client/server architecture replaces in-process CLI

Phases 0–6 of the `dikw-core-client-server-eventual-clarke` plan
collapse the in-process invocation model. The engine now runs as a
long-lived `dikw serve` process; the CLI is a thin httpx + NDJSON
client that talks to it over `/v1/`.

* **Removed**: `dikw mcp` subcommand and the entire `mcp_server.py`
  module. The MCP runtime dependency is gone from `pyproject.toml` and
  every `mcp.*` reference in code and docs is scrubbed (eval-dataset
  fixture text under `evals/datasets/` is left alone — that's corpus
  content, not engine docs).
* **Removed**: in-process implementations of `dikw status`,
  `dikw check`, `dikw ingest`, `dikw query`, `dikw synth`,
  `dikw lint`, `dikw distill`, `dikw review *`, `dikw eval`. These
  commands are now thin HTTP clients; running any of them requires a
  reachable `dikw serve` instance (or `dikw serve-and-run` for one-shot
  use).
* **Added**: `dikw serve --base <path>` — FastAPI + Uvicorn server.
  Defaults to `127.0.0.1:8765` with no auth on loopback; non-loopback
  hosts require `DIKW_SERVER_TOKEN`. Routes documented in
  [`docs/server.md`](./docs/server.md).
* **Added**: `dikw client *` subcommand group — full remote surface
  (status / check / init / ingest / query / synth / lint / distill /
  eval / review / tasks). Top-level aliases (`dikw status` etc.) keep
  the previous muscle memory working; they now route through the same
  HTTP client.
* **Added**: `dikw client serve-and-run -- <cmd> [args]` — spawns a
  local server, waits for `/v1/healthz`, runs the inner command
  against it, and tears it down. Use this for one-off ingest/query
  flows when you don't want to manage a long-lived server. Picks a
  free port automatically; `--keep-alive` leaves the server up.
* **Added**: NDJSON streaming for long ops (`ingest`, `synth`,
  `distill`, `eval`) and for `query`. Each event is a JSON line; the
  transport drops `heartbeat` events at the client layer. Task
  endpoints support `?from_seq=N` resume so a disconnected client can
  rejoin without missing events.
* **Added**: `POST /v1/upload/sources` — multipart tar.gz + manifest
  upload that the client packs from a local directory. Server
  validates sha256 per file before staging, and the ingest task
  references the staged tree by `upload_id`.
* **Added**: `dikw_core.progress.ProgressReporter` Protocol — the
  engine emits structured progress events (`progress`, `log`,
  `partial`) via this hook; the server bridges them onto the NDJSON
  task event stream, in-process callers (tests, the eval runner) can
  pass `NoopReporter()` and ignore them.
* **Changed**: dependencies. Added `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`,
  `python-multipart`. Dropped `mcp`. The `dikw-core[postgres]` extra is
  unchanged.

### Migration

If you scripted against the old in-process CLI:

* **`dikw status`** etc. — still works, but the server must be
  running. Replace `dikw status` with either `dikw serve-and-run --
  status` or run `dikw serve` in a separate terminal first.
* **`dikw mcp --stdio`** — gone. There is no shim. Adapt to the HTTP
  surface (the wire shape is documented in
  [`docs/server.md`](./docs/server.md)) or pin to the last release
  containing MCP.
* **Configuration** — `dikw.yml` is unchanged. Client-side settings
  (server URL, token) live in `~/.config/dikw/client.toml` or
  `DIKW_SERVER_URL` / `DIKW_SERVER_TOKEN` env vars.
