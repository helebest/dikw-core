"""TaskStore Protocol + persistent task row + status enum.

Every long-running task has a ``TaskRow`` row plus an append-only
``task_events`` log. Concrete stores live in sibling files
(``store_sqlite.py``, ``store_postgres.py``) and are resolved by the
``build_task_store`` factory in ``server/tasks/__init__.py``.

The store boundary is *engine-agnostic*: it only knows about generic
op names ("ingest", "synth", "echo", …) + JSON dicts. The TaskManager
on top translates between domain types and dicts.
