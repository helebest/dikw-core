"""Local md+assets → tar.gz + per-md packages manifest.

The client packages each markdown file together with its referenced
assets as a single logical "package" inside one tar.gz + manifest, and
ships them via ``POST /v1/import`` (multipart upload at the transport
layer; "import" at the business layer — see CONTEXT.md). The server
validates each package independently, commits the well-formed ones
into ``<base>/sources/`` directly, and reports per-package outcomes.

Pre-flight inspection (frontmatter parse, missing asset, empty body,
