"""FastAPI app factory.

Single entry point — ``build_app`` — composes the runtime factory, auth
dependency, sync routes, task routes, and error handlers. The CLI's
``dikw serve`` command instantiates this and hands it to uvicorn; tests
build it with an injected runtime factory so they don't need a real
storage backend.
