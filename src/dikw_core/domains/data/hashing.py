"""Hash helpers shared across D layer + server commit + client upload.

``hash_file`` lives in :mod:`dikw_core.md_inspect` so the client (which
can't import from ``domains/``) and the engine share one implementation.
This module re-exports it under the historical name so existing callers
stay intact.
