"""Client-side long-poll loop that drives every ``--wait`` UX.

Used by:

* ``--wait`` on ``dikw client {ingest, synth, distill, eval, lint
  propose, lint apply}`` — submit + block + render + exit-code map.
* ``dikw client tasks wait <id>`` — same loop, applied to an existing
  task_id.

Replaces the NDJSON ``stream_ndjson(/events)`` loop deleted in PR4.
The wire contract is now the cursor JSON ``EventsPage`` (one HTTP call
per page; server holds for up to ``poll_wait`` seconds), so this
module owns the cursor advance, terminal short-circuit, and total-
budget logic that used to live inline at each op command.

Design notes:

* No retries on transport errors — :class:`ClientError` bubbles up to
  the CLI layer, which renders a clean message + exits.
* The renderer is optional and **stateless from this module's point of
  view** — we just call ``renderer.render(event)`` for each event,
  including ``final``. The caller controls the live widget lifecycle.
* ``total_timeout`` is a *client-side* budget; expiry raises
  :class:`TimeoutError` and the CLI maps it to exit 124. The task
  itself is *not* auto-cancelled — agents that wanted that chain a
  ``dikw tasks cancel`` themselves.
