"""Fixer for ``broken_wikilink`` issues.

Two-stage strategy:

1. **Heuristic** (always on). Normalize every K-layer page title
   (lower + strip puncs + collapse whitespace) and the broken target
   the lint scanner recovered, fuzzy-match via
   :class:`difflib.SequenceMatcher`, and propose an in-place
   ``[[link]]`` rewrite when the ratio crosses
   :data:`HEURISTIC_RATIO_THRESHOLD`.

2. **Evidence-backed LLM repair** (#83, opt-in via
   :attr:`FixerContext.enable_llm`). When the heuristic misses, search
   D/I-layer chunks for the broken target; if there is enough source
   evidence to ground a real page, ask the LLM to write one. If
   evidence is insufficient, or if the LLM returns a TODO-laced /
   too-short body, raise :class:`FixerSkip` with a structured reason
   so the propose-task result tells an agent *why* the wikilink stays
   unrepaired (was previously a generic ``"fixer returned None"``).

   This replaces the PR2 TODO-stub fallback: ``--enable-llm`` now means
   "let the LLM perform an evidence-backed repair when possible", not
   "let the LLM fabricate placeholder pages that hide broken_wikilink
   from the next lint pass".

Provider outages / unparseable LLM output remain soft failures
(``return None``) — they are operational noise, not product semantics,
and would otherwise flood ``FixProposalReport.skipped`` with reasons
the user can't act on.
