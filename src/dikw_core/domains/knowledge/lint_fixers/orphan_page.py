"""Fixer for ``orphan_page`` issues.

An orphan page has no inbound K-layer wikilinks. The fixer triages
each orphan into one of four reviewable strategies, picked in order
from most conservative to most invasive:

1. ``delete_page`` — body is a near-empty stub with no outbound
   wikilinks; soft-delete to ``trash/``.
2. ``merge_into_existing_page`` — a candidate parent scores above
   ``MERGE_THRESHOLD`` and ``ctx.enable_llm`` is on. The LLM rewrites
   the parent body to absorb the orphan; apply emits two ops
   ``[update_page(parent), delete_page(orphan)]``.
3. ``link_from_existing_page`` — a candidate parent scores above
   ``LINK_THRESHOLD``; emit an ``update_page`` op that appends a
   ``[[orphan]]`` reference to the parent's body.
4. ``mark_as_leaf`` — nothing else applies. Write
   ``lint: {skip: [orphan_page], reason}`` into the orphan's
   frontmatter so the next lint pass treats it as an acknowledged
   terminal note. Always-on tail strategy — better an actionable
   proposal (the user can reject it) than a silent skip.
